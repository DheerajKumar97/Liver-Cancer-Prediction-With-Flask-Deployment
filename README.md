# Project Goal

 **This Project is to designed to predict the probability of having Liver Cancer Prediction using Python, Flask, HTML**

# Project Motivation

**Classification problem in health care is very much interesting, iam interested to solve the problem of liver cancer using Machine Learning because it will be helpful to know that we are in danger and should undergo treatment for that**

# Requirements Installation

**The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository**

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
# The Python file has following sections:

## IPL Score Prediction.py

1- **Data Preprocessing** and some **Exploratory Data Analysis** to understand the data

2- **Data preparation**: **Feature Engineering** and Scaling
